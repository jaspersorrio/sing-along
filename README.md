## Automated verse scrolling

singalong aims to provide instrument players a helper that helps them scroll through the song automagically.

## Features to implement

### Automagic scrolling

singalong will help you scroll based on what you have sang or played.


#### Foresight

The verses should 'fade out' when they are no longer active.

e.g

###### You call me out upon the waters

##### The great unknown where feet may fail
 
#### And there I find You in the mystery

### In oceans deep

## My faith will stand

# And I will call upon Your name

## And keep my eyes above the waves

### When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
 
##### For I am Yours and You are mine

###### Your grace abounds in deepest waters



### Screen broadcast
